1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,700
Now, I don't want to extend these proceedings,

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,220
but really to sit there and give answers

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,660
like that was a small part of the discussion,

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,180
somehow suggesting therefore you didn't have the need

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,540
to be full and frank, or it excuses your answers,

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,900
doesn't really wash.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,700
I don't think I am making excuses.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,740
I'm explaining.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,900
Those explanations don't hold any water.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,620
Can we move on?

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,260
I'm sorry you feel like that.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:30,500
Yes, I do feel like that.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,620
I'm really sorry you feel like that.

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,020
Thank you.

15
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,900
Genuinely, I'm trying to, as per the affirmation I've made,

16
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,860
I'm giving you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,540
but the truth.

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:40,860
Right.

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,580
And the answers I'm providing to you.

20
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,660
Let's move on to another point.

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,980
The Facebook did not inform any of the 270,000 users

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,340
or their friends that the information had

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,500
been illegitimately accessed, correct?

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,700
Well, the 270,000, no, you're correct.

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,180
Thank you.

26
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,060
The first time Facebook announced this

27
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,180
was last week, more than two years after it found out

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,020
about the breach, correct?

29
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,050
Yes.

30
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,370
Your CEO says in a CNN interview,

31
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,090
I regret we didn't do it at the time.

32
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,610
I think we got that wrong.

33
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,690
You accept that?

34
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,010
Yes, and I've said that already.

35
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,850
And all of this conduct goes against the professed

36
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,050
commitments of Facebook.

37
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,450
I read those out just now, of being transparent about it,
